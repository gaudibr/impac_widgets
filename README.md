This is an attempt to solve the impac! widget exercise by cesar-tonnoir

Yet to be done:

* employee locations widget:
  * <strike>reduce locations that have same/similar coordinates</strike>
  * <strike>alter the size/display of each marker depending on number of employees for location</strike>
  * <strike>set display to encompass as many locations as there are in the map (with dynamic zoom)</strike>
  * <strike>set map to calculate center based on locations</strike>
* implement sales channel widget
* improve interface (switch widgets by type)
* add exception handling
* add testing
* angular
  * separate templates and group controllers/factories by theme (currently only one)
* Improve documentation (both on readme and throughout code)
* Performance:
  * introduce a caching model to store locations an avoid geocoder to consume google api resources
* Make widget dynamic for different organizations
